# NY-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions

### Project Overview
This project analyzes the New York City Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset, which contains over 3.7 million records of vehicle collisions from 2012 to the present. The project involves data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization using Python. The goal is to gain insights from the data by answering specific queries related to vehicle makes and types.

The project demonstrates Python programming skills in data analysis, including handling large datasets, preprocessing, and visualizing data using popular libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

### Objectives and Tasks
1. **Preprocessing:**
Extract data for the specified years.
Clean the dataset by removing rows with missing or invalid values.
Take a representative sample of the data for initial analysis.

2. **Analysis Queries:**

- Vehicle Make Analysis: Count the number of accidents for each vehicle make and plot a bar graph comparing the two specified years.
- Monthly Accident Trends: Compare monthly accident counts for each vehicle make and plot the data as a line graph.
- Vehicle Type Analysis: Calculate the percentage of crashes involving each vehicle type and visualize it using a pie chart.

3. **Visualizations:**

- Bar graph of accidents per vehicle make.
- Line graph of monthly accidents per vehicle make.
- Pie chart representing the percentage of accidents per vehicle type.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Google Colab

### Results
- Bar Graph: Accidents by vehicle make for each year.
- Line Graph: Monthly accident trends for each vehicle make.
- Pie Chart: Percentage of accidents for each vehicle type.

### Contributions
This project was completed as part of the Foundations of Computing course. Contributions to this project are welcome, particularly suggestions on improving the analysis or adding additional insights.
